Text-to-speech — converts text to speech ("read this chapter to me").

Python structure + JSON contract for this feature.

INPUT (JSON) — what this engine receives:

    "text": "The second law of thermodynamics states..."
}

OUTPUT (JSON) — what this engine returns:
{
    "audio": "<audio file reference>"
}

Note: JSON shapes are proposed, not final (see json.md).
